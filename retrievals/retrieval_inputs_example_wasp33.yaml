##### Priors #####

# Here, we define the priors for the parameters.
# The priors are defined as a list with the following format:
# [prior_type, prior_arg_1, prior_arg_2, ...]
# The prior_type is a string that defines the type of prior.
# It can be one of the default priors found in retrieval_utils.default_prior_func.
# or a custom prior function (see explanation below).
# The prior_args are the arguments needed for the prior function.

# The default priors are:
# - uniform or log_uniform: Uniform prior between prior_arg_1 and prior_arg_2
# - gaussian: Gaussian prior with mean prior_arg_1 and standard deviation prior_arg_2
# 
# NOTE: The difference between uniform and log_uniform is that the values are
# converted to log scale (exponentiated) when creating the theta_dict.
# Ex:
# >>> params_prior['CO'] = ['log_uniform', -12.0, -0.5]
# will give in the logl function:
# >>> theta_dict['CO'] = 10 ** theta_dict['CO']

# - Note about Abundances priors -
# In the current example, we don't use chemical equilibrium, so the priors are set for each molecule.
# Note that if you want to fit only a subset of the molecules in line_opacities, continuum_opacities and other_species,
# you need to assign a value to the species that are not fitted in fixed_params.
# Here is an example of a possible set of priors:
params_prior:
  # You don't need to add the species since they can be automatically added
  # based on the species_in_prior list.
  # But if you want to manually add the species in the prior, you can add it here.
  # In this example, I want to fit the e- in other_species, but not H, so I add it here.
  # CO: [log_uniform, -12.0, -0.5]

  # Orbital parameters
  rv: [uniform, -40, 40]  # For RV
  kp: [uniform, 100, 250]  # For RV

  # TP-profile parameters
  T_eq: [uniform, 100, 4500]  # For iso, guillot and modif
  tp_gamma: [log_uniform, -2, 6]  # For guillot and modif
  # kappa_IR: [log_uniform, -4, 0]  # For guillot
  gravity: [uniform, 1000, 10000]  # For guillot
  tp_delta: [log_uniform, -8, -3]  # For modif
  ptrans: [log_uniform, -8, 3]  # For modif
  tp_alpha: [uniform, -1.0, 1.0]  # For modif

  # Other parameters related to the atmosphere
  # params_prior['p_cloud'] = ['log_uniform', -5.0, 2]
  # params_prior['R_pl'] = ['uniform', 1.0, 1.6]

  # Scaling factor for WFC3 uncertainties
  # params_prior['log_f'] = ['uniform', -2, 3]  # yes, it is a uniform prior, not a log_uniform


# If the planet is splitted in multiple regions,
# specify which parameters are specific to each region.
# Each region is identified with an ID starting at 1 (not 0).
region_id: [1] 

# List of parameters that are specific to each region (some parameters are shared by all regions)
# It won't do anything if there is only one region.
# Put empty list if not used.
reg_params: []


# Dictionary of fixed parameters for each region.
# It may be useful to fix some parameters in specific regions.
# In this example, we force a low water abundance in region 2.
reg_fixed_params: 
  # H2O_2: 1e-12  # Force water abundance to ~zero in region 2


#### Note about theta_dict ####

# Apart from all the parameters in the fixed_params and params_prior dictionnaries,
# the theta_dict will also contain the following parameters:
# - pressure: The pressure grid used for the model
# - temperatures: The temperature grid used for the model, computed based on the TP profile parameters
# - M_pl: The planet mass in Jupiter mass
# - R_pl: The planet radius in Jupiter radius
# - R_star: The star radius in Solar radius

# The custom functions (like the rotation kernel function or custom priors)
# are expected to receive the full theta_dict as an argument.
# This way, they can access all the parameters needed for the model.


#####################################################
# --- Custom prior functions ---
#####################################################
# The default prior functions are defined in the retrieval_utils module.
# If you want to add your own prior function, you can put the function in a file
# which will be imported in the script.
# The prior function should take `theta_dict`, `param` and `prior_args` as arguments
# Where `param` is the key of the parameter in `theta_dict`
# and `prior_args` is a list regrouping all arguments defined
# in `params_prior`, after the prior type.
# NOTE: Some prior functions may use other parameters (fitted or not). That's why
# the function is taking the full `theta_dict` as an argument.
# Here is an example of the uniform prior function in retrieval_utils:
# 
# def uniform_prior(theta_dict, key, prior_inputs):
#     """Uniform prior"""
#     x = theta_dict[key]
#     low, high = prior_inputs
#     if x < low:
#         out = -np.inf
#     elif x > high:
#         out = -np.inf
#     else:
#         out = 0.
# 
#     return out
# 
#####################################################
# --- Custom prior initialisation functions ---
#####################################################
# Each prior type should have an initialisation function, which is used to
# initialise the walkers (to start the burnin phase for example).
# If a custom prior function is defined, it should also have an initialisation function in the same file.
# The initialisation function should take `prior_inputs` and `n_wlkr` (the number of walker) as arguments.
# It should return a sample of the prior distribution with the shape (n_wlkr, 1).
# (The empty dimension is important to combine the samples with the other parameters in the theta_dict.)
# Here is an example of the uniform prior initialisation function in retrieval_utils:
#
# def init_uniform_prior(prior_inputs, n_wlkr):
#     """Initialize from uniform prior"""
#     low, high = prior_inputs
#     sample = np.random.uniform(low, high, size=(n_wlkr, 1))

#     return sample
#
# Now, in the file with the custom prior function, you also need 2 dictionaries named
# prior_init_func and prior_func, that assign a name (a string) to the initialisation
# function and the prior function.
# Here is an example of the dictionary for the uniform prior:
# prior_init_func = {'custom_uniform': init_uniform_prior}
# prior_func = {'custom_uniform': uniform_prior}

# Put here the full adress to the file containing the custom prior function
# Set to null if not used
custom_prior_file: null

# --- Special treatment for the initialisation of some parameters ---
# Some parameters may need a special treatment for the initialisation from the prior.
# For instance, I recommend to start initialise the retrieval with a kp value
# and a rv value close to the expected values, since we have a good idea of what they should be.
# This will improve the convergence of the retrieval.
special_init:
  kp: ['uniform', 200, 250]
  rv: ['uniform', -30, 30]
  CO: ['log_uniform', -5.0, -2.0]
  Fe: ['log_uniform', -6.0, -2.0]
  T_eq: ['uniform', 2500, 3500]

# --- Rotation kernel function ---
# It is possible to use a custom function to generate the rotation kernel.
# The function should take as input `theta_regions` and `tr_i`.
# `theta_regions` is a list of `theta_dict` for each region, where `theta_dict` is a dictionnary
# with all the parameters needed for the model of region.
# `tr_i` is the index of the high resolution data sequence.
# The function should return a list of rotation kernels (a 1D array) at the same sampling
# and resolution as the data (so uses instrum['resol'] and lbl_res).
# The function should be named `get_ker`.
# Here is an example of a function that generates a Citrus rotation kernel:
#
# def get_ker(theta_regions, tr_i=0):
#     all_phases = (data_trs[tr_i]['t_start'] - planet.mid_tr.value) / planet.period.to('d').value % 1
#     mean_phase = np.mean(all_phases[data_trs[tr_i]['i_pl_signal']])  # Only  where there is planet signal
#     theta_dict = theta_regions[0]
#     longitudes = [theta_dict['phase1'], 0.99]
#     R_pl = theta_dict['R_pl'] * 0.01  # cgs to SI  (cm to m)
#     angular_freq = 2 * np.pi / planet.period[0].to('s').value
#     rot_factor = theta_dict['rot_factor']
#
#     ker_obj = CitrusRotationKernel(longitudes, R_pl, rot_factor * angular_freq, instrum['resol'])
#
#     rot_ker = ker_obj.resample(lbl_res, phase=mean_phase, n_os=1000)
#
#     return rot_ker
#
# The full or relative path to the file is the input here.
# If set to null, only the instrumental profile will be used to convolve the model.
get_ker_file: null
